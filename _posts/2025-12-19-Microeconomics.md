# 🧠 Theory of Consumer Behavior

### *The Science of "Why We Buy"*

At its core, consumer behavior is the study of **rationality**. It asks: *Given limited money (scarcity) and unlimited wants, how does a person decide which basket of goods will make them the happiest?*

Economists have evolved two major schools of thought to answer this:

1. **Cardinal Utility** (The Old School: *"Happiness can be measured."*)
2. **Ordinal Utility** (The Modern School: *"Happiness can only be ranked."*)

---

## 1. The Cardinal Utility Approach

**Principal Architect:** Alfred Marshall

**Core Philosophy:** Satisfaction is quantifiable.

Imagine if you had an internal "happiness thermometer." Every time you ate a slice of pizza, the thermometer would rise by a specific degree. Marshall called these degrees of happiness **"Utils."**

> **🗣️ Famous Insight:**
> *"The price of every thing rises and falls from time to time and place to place; and with every such change the purchasing power of money changes."* — **Alfred Marshall**

### A. Key Concepts

* **Total Utility (TU):** The sum total of satisfaction gained from consuming a specific quantity of a commodity.
* **Marginal Utility (MU):** The *additional* satisfaction gained from consuming *one more* unit.
* Formula: 



### B. The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility (DMU)

This is the heart of Cardinal theory. It states: **As you consume more of a good, the extra satisfaction from each additional unit declines.**

**🍕 The "Pizza Paradox" Example:**

* **Slice 1:** You are starving. The taste is heavenly. **Utility: 20 Utils.**
* **Slice 2:** Still good, but you aren't as hungry. **Utility: 15 Utils.**
* **Slice 3:** You are starting to feel full. **Utility: 5 Utils.**
* **Slice 4:** You feel sick. **Utility: -2 Utils (Negative Utility).**

### C. Consumer Equilibrium (The "Best Buy" Point)

A consumer is in equilibrium when they cannot increase their satisfaction by rearranging their spending.

**For a single commodity ():**
You buy until the "worth" of the good equals the price you pay.


**For two commodities ( and ):**
The Law of Equi-Marginal Utility applies. You stop buying when the last dollar spent on Good X gives the same satisfaction as the last dollar spent on Good Y.


---

## 2. The Ordinal Utility Approach (Indifference Curves)

**Principal Architects:** J.R. Hicks and R.G.D. Allen (1930s)

**Core Philosophy:** Satisfaction is subjective and cannot be measured in numbers—only **ranked**.

Hicks argued that we don't say, *"This coffee gives me 10 utils and that tea gives me 5."* Instead, we say, *"I **prefer** coffee over tea."*

> **🗣️ Insight:**
> *"We do not need to assume that utility is quantitatively measurable... We only need to assume that the consumer can tell us whether he prefers A to B, or B to A, or is indifferent between them."*

### A. The Indifference Curve (IC)

An Indifference Curve represents all combinations of two goods (bundles) that give the consumer the **exact same level of satisfaction**.

**Imagine a "Bundle of Joy":**

* **Bundle A:** 1 Burger + 10 Fries
* **Bundle B:** 2 Burgers + 5 Fries
* If you are equally happy with either combo, they lie on the same **Indifference Curve**. You are "indifferent" to choosing between them.

### B. Properties of Indifference Curves

1. **Downward Sloping:** To get more of Good X, you *must* give up some of Good Y to stay equally happy.
2. **Convex to the Origin:** This is due to the **Diminishing Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)**.
* *Real-World Logic:* If you have 100 Burgers and 1 Fry, you'd happily trade 20 Burgers just to get 1 more Fry. But if you have 1 Burger and 100 Fries, you wouldn't give up your last Burger for anything. You value what you have less of more highly.


3. **IC curves never intersect:** If they did, it would logically mean that 10 units of happiness equals 20 units of happiness, which is impossible.
4. **Higher IC = Higher Satisfaction:** A curve further to the right represents more goods, and therefore more happiness (Monotonic Preference).

### C. The Budget Line (The Reality Check)

You might *want* to be on the highest Indifference Curve (infinite goods), but your wallet stops you. The Budget Line shows all possible combinations of two goods you can buy with your given income.

### D. Consumer Equilibrium (Ordinal)

Where does the consumer actually settle?

* It happens at the **tangency point**—where the Budget Line just barely touches the highest possible Indifference Curve.
* At this point, the slope of what you are *willing* to trade (MRS) equals the slope of what the market *allows* you to trade (Price Ratio).

# 🕵️ Revealed Preference Theory

### *The "Actions Speak Louder Than Words" Approach*

**Principal Architect:** Paul Samuelson (1938)

**Core Philosophy:** Ignore what consumers *say* about their happiness. Watch what they *do*.

Before Samuelson, economists relied on introspection (Cardinal) or ranking (Ordinal) to map preferences. Samuelson flipped the script: **If a consumer chooses Bundle A when Bundle B was also affordable, they have "revealed" that they prefer A to B.**

> **🗣️ The Mantra:**
> *"Choice reveals preference."*

### A. The Setup

Imagine you are at a supermarket. You have a budget.

* **Bundle A:** 1 Apple, 2 Bananas ($5 total)
* **Bundle B:** 2 Apples, 1 Banana ($5 total)

If you buy **Bundle A**, you have "revealed" that A is better than B. You didn't buy A because it was cheaper (they cost the same)—you bought it because you *liked* it more.

### B. The Two Commandments (Axioms)

#### 1. Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference (WARP)

* **The Rule:** Consistency in direct choices.
* **The Logic:** If you choose **A** over **B** today, you cannot choose **B** over **A** tomorrow *unless* **A** has become more expensive (unaffordable).
* **Visual Check:** If your choices cross over each other inconsistency on a graph, you are acting irrationally (violating WARP).

#### 2. Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference (SARP)

* **The Rule:** Consistency in chains of choices (Transitivity).
* **The Logic:**
* If you choose **A** over **B**...
* And you choose **B** over **C**...
* Then you **MUST** choose **A** over **C**.


* **The Cycle Trap:** You cannot prefer A > B > C > A. That is a logical loop of doom.

### C. Why is this cool?

It allows economists to build **Demand Curves** entirely from observing prices and quantities bought, without ever needing to see inside your head or draw an indifference curve first.

# 🎲 Consumer Behavior Under Risk & Uncertainty

### *The Economics of "Rolling the Dice"*

Most economic theories assume we know everything (prices, quality, income). But in real life, the future is foggy. We buy insurance, play the lottery, and invest in stocks. How do we make rational choices when the outcome is a gamble?

### A. The Great Divide: Risk vs. Uncertainty

Economist **Frank Knight** (1921) drew a famous line in the sand:

| Feature | **Risk** 🎲 | **Uncertainty** 🌫️ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Definition** | You don't know the outcome, but you know the **probabilities**. | You don't know the outcome, and you **don't** know the probabilities. |
| **Example** | Flipping a coin (50/50 chance). | A terrorist attack or a new virus outbreak. |
| **Solvability** | Can be insured (actuarial tables). | Hard to insure (requires guesswork). |

> **🗣️ Knight's Insight:**
> *"Profit is the reward for taking uncertainty, not risk."*

### B. The St. Petersburg Paradox & The Solution

**The Puzzle:** Imagine a game where I toss a coin until it lands Heads.

* If Heads on toss 1: You win $2.
* If Heads on toss 2: You win $4.
* If Heads on toss 3: You win $8.
* **Expected Value (EV):** Infinite dollars! ()

**The Paradox:** Even though the mathematical "value" is infinite, most people wouldn't pay more than $20 to play. Why?

**The Solution (Bernoulli):** We don't care about **Expected Money**; we care about **Expected Utility**.

* Winning the first $1 million makes you huge happy.
* Winning the *next* $1 million makes you only slightly happier.
* This is the **Diminishing Marginal Utility of Wealth**.

---

### C. Von Neumann-Morgenstern (VNM) Utility

This theory quantifies how we choose between gambles.


* **:** Probability of the event.
* **:** The utility you get from the payoff.

### D. Attitudes Toward Risk

We can classify people by the *shape* of their utility curve.

#### 1. Risk Averse ( The Normie 🛡️)

* **Profile:** Dislikes variance. Would rather have $50 guaranteed than a 50/50 coin flip for $100 or $0.
* **Graph:** **Concave** (curve bends downwards).
* **Logic:** The pain of losing $100 hurts *more* than the joy of winning $100.
* **Behavior:** Buys Insurance.

#### 2. Risk Neutral (The Robot 🤖)

* **Profile:** Only cares about the average payout (Expected Value). Indifferent between $50 guaranteed and the coin flip.
* **Graph:** **Linear** (Straight line).
* **Behavior:** Maximizes profit, ignores safety.

#### 3. Risk Loving (The Gambler 🎰)

* **Profile:** Prefers the thrill. Would trade $50 guaranteed for a 50/50 shot at $100.
* **Graph:** **Convex** (curve bends upwards).
* **Logic:** The joy of winning is worth the risk of losing.
* **Behavior:** Plays lotteries, day trades crypto.

---

### E. Key Metrics for the Risk Averse

1. **Certainty Equivalent (CE):**
The cash amount usually *lower* than the expected value that makes you say, *"Okay, I'll take this cash and walk away from the gamble."*
* *Example:* The gamble is worth $100 on average. You are scared of risk, so you'd happily accept **$80** guaranteed to avoid playing. $80 is your CE.


2. **Risk Premium:**
The amount you are "paying" to avoid the risk.


* *From above:* $100 (EV) - $80 (CE) = **$20 Risk Premium.** (This is essentially why insurance companies exist!).

# 🏭 Theory of Production: Creative Notes

> *"Production is not the creation of matter, but the creation of utility."* — **A. Marshall**

### 1. The Core Concept

**Production** is the process of transforming inputs (resources) into outputs (goods/services) that satisfy human wants. It is the "supply side" of the market equation.

* **Inputs (Factors of Production):** Land, Labor (), Capital (), Entrepreneurship.
* **Output:** The final consumable or intermediate good ().

---

### 2. The Production Function

The mathematical relationship between physical inputs and physical outputs.


#### A. The Two Time Horizons

In economics, time is not measured by a calendar, but by the **flexibility of inputs**.

| Feature | **Short Run** | **Long Run** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Definition** | Period where at least **one** factor is fixed (usually Capital). | Period where **all** factors are variable. |
| **Flexibility** | Firms can only adjust variable inputs (like Labor). | Firms can adjust scale, technology, and machinery. |
| **Law** | **Law of Variable Proportions** | **Returns to Scale** |
| **Cost Constraint** | Faces Fixed Costs (FC) + Variable Costs (VC). | All costs are Variable. |

#### B. Short Run: Law of Variable Proportions

Also known as the *Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns*. As we add more units of a variable input (Labor) to a fixed input (Land):

1. **Stage I (Increasing Returns):** Total Product (TP) rises at an increasing rate. Marginal Product (MP) rises.
2. **Stage II (Diminishing Returns):** TP rises at a decreasing rate. MP falls but is positive. **(Rational producer operates here)**.
3. **Stage III (Negative Returns):** TP falls. MP becomes negative.

#### C. Long Run: Returns to Scale

How output changes when **all** inputs are increased proportionately.

* **Increasing Returns to Scale (IRS):** Output more than doubles when inputs double.
* **Constant Returns to Scale (CRS):** Output exactly doubles when inputs double.
* **Decreasing Returns to Scale (DRS):** Output less than doubles when inputs double.

---

### 3. Cobb-Douglas Production Function

The most famous empirical production function, introduced by Charles Cobb and Paul Douglas (1928).

Where:

*  = Total Output
*  = Total Factor Productivity (Technology/Efficiency parameter)
*  = Labor input
*  = Capital input
*  = Output elasticity of Labor ()
*  = Output elasticity of Capital ()

#### Key Properties (The "Cheat Sheet")

1. **Constant Returns to Scale (CRS):** If , the function exhibits CRS. (If , IRS; if , DRS).
2. **Diminishing Marginal Returns:** Because  and  are less than 1, the Marginal Product of Labor () and Capital () diminish as inputs increase.
3. **Factor Intensity:** Determined by the ratio of  to . If , the technique is labor-intensive.
4. **Euler’s Theorem:** If , total output is exhausted by paying factors their marginal products ().

> **Example:** If , a 1% increase in Labor increases Output by 0.7%. Since , this firm has Constant Returns to Scale.

---

### 4. Cost and Revenue Curves

#### A. Cost Curves (Short Run)

Cost curves are derived from the production function. They are generally **U-shaped** due to the Law of Variable Proportions.

* **TC (Total Cost):** TFC + TVC.
* **AC (Average Cost):** TC / Q. U-shaped.
* **MC (Marginal Cost):** Change in TC / Change in Q. "The Nike Swoosh" shape.

**Crucial Relationship:**


* When ,  falls.
* When ,  rises.

#### B. Revenue Curves

Revenue depends on the market structure.

| **Perfect Competition** | **Monopoly / Imperfect Competition** |
| --- | --- |
| Price is constant. | Price must fall to sell more output. |
| **AR = MR = Price** | **AR > MR** (MR curve is below AR). |
| Curve is a horizontal straight line. | Curves are downward sloping. |

---

### 5. Technical Progress

Technical progress shifts the production function upward ( increases with same inputs). It is classified based on how it affects the **Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution (MRTS)** or the ratio of Marginal Products ().

#### A. Neutral Technical Progress

Technical change is "neutral" if it does not favor one factor over the other in a specific way.

1. **Hicks Neutral:**
* The ratio of marginal products () remains **unchanged** for a given Capital-Labor ratio ().
* *Visual:* The isoquant shifts inward (needs less input) but its slope remains the same along any ray from the origin.
* 


2. **Harrod Neutral (Labor Augmenting):**
* Keeps the **Capital-Output ratio ()** constant at a constant Rate of Profit (Marginal Product of Capital).
* This effectively increases the efficiency of labor.
* 


3. **Solow Neutral (Capital Augmenting):**
* Keeps the **Labor-Output ratio ()** constant at a constant Wage Rate.
* This effectively increases the efficiency of capital.
* 



#### B. Non-Neutral (Biased) Technical Progress

If the innovation alters the ratio of marginal products () at a constant capital-labor ratio:

* **Capital-Saving (Labor-Using):**
* Increases  more than .
* At a constant  ratio, the ratio  falls.
* *Effect:* Entrepreneurs substitute labor for capital.


* **Labor-Saving (Capital-Using):**
* Increases  more than .
* At a constant  ratio, the ratio  rises.
* *Effect:* Entrepreneurs substitute capital for labor (Automation).



### Summary Table: Types of Progress

| Type | Effect on  (at constant ) | Augmentation Form |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hicks Neutral** | Constant |  |
| **Harrod Neutral** | - |  (Labor Augmenting) |
| **Solow Neutral** | - |  (Capital Augmenting) |
| **Labor Saving** | Increases (Capital becomes relatively more productive) | Bias toward Capital |
| **Capital Saving** | Decreases (Labor becomes relatively more productive) | Bias toward Labor |
